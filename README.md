## Using with npx and .env file

You can run this MCP server directly using npx without installing it globally:

```bash
npx -y @instawp/mcp-wp
```

Make sure you have a `.env` file in your current directory with the following variables:

```env
WORDPRESS_API_URL=https://your-wordpress-site.com/wp-json/wp/v2
WORDPRESS_USERNAME=wp_username
WORDPRESS_PASSWORD=wp_app_password
```

## Development

### Prerequisites

*   **Node.js and npm:** Ensure you have Node.js (version 18 or higher) and npm installed.
*   **WordPress Site:** You need an active WordPress site with the REST API enabled.
*   **WordPress API Authentication:** Set up authentication for the WordPress REST API. This typically requires an authentication plugin or method (like Application Passwords).
*   **MCP Client:** You need an application that can communicate with the MCP Server. Currently, Claude Desktop is recommended.

### Installation and Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd wordpress-mcp-server
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Create a `.env` file:**

    Create a `.env` file in the root of your project directory and add your WordPress API credentials:

    ```env
    WORDPRESS_API_URL=https://your-wordpress-site.com/wp-json/wp/v2
    WORDPRESS_USERNAME=wp_username
    WORDPRESS_PASSWORD=wp_app_password
    ```

    Replace the placeholders with your actual values.

4.  **Build the Server:**

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

5. **Configure Claude Desktop:**

   * Open Claude Desktop settings and navigate to the "Developer" tab.
   * Click "Edit Config" to open the `claude_desktop_config.json` file.
   * Add a new server configuration under the `mcpServers` section. You will need to provide the **absolute** path to the `build/server.js` file and your WordPress environment variables.
   * Save the configuration.

### Running the Server

Once you've configured Claude Desktop, the server should start automatically whenever Claude Desktop starts.

You can also run the server directly from the command line for testing:

```bash
npm start
```

or in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Security

*   **Never commit your API keys or secrets to version control.**
*   **Use HTTPS for communication between the client and server.**
*   **Validate all inputs received from the client to prevent injection attacks.**
*   **Implement proper error handling and rate limiting.**
